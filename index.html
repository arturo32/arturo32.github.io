				<p>
					Hi! My name is Arturo Fonseca de Souza. I am a 23 year old IT student at the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte
					(Brazil). For the last 2 years I have been working with <em>web development</em> in scholarships, furthering my knowledge
					in the <em>backend</em> side as well as the <em>frontend</em>.
				</p>

				<p>
					I really like learning new things and making them more accessible to people. This was my main motivation behind one of my
					dearest personal projects: a website where anyone can visualize and understand
					<a href="https://github.com/arturo32/HowPointersWork">how pointers work</a> in programming languages. It is still in the
					early stages of development, but I am determined to finish it this year!
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Outside developing web applications, I have a big passion for geometry and mathematics in general. This led me down a path
					of studies where I discovered the wonders of <em>computer graphics</em>. After finally taking a course in the subject at
					my university, I was sure that this was something I wanted to pursue more deeply.
				</p>

				

				<p>My other interests include folding origami, taking pictures, messing around a bit with electronics and watching videos about music theory.</p>

											This one I've taken from a <a href="https://twitter.com/FreyaHolmer/status/1244407595059884033?s=20">Twitter
											thread</a> by <a href="https://acegikmo.com/">Freya Holmér</a>. I was used to the idea of linear interpolation
											for the Drawing Project, but I had never heard of interpolating between three points at the time.
										</p>

										<p>
											As Freya says in her thread, to calculate the influence of each triangle vertex in an arbitrary point you have
											to take the <em>area</em> of the inner triangle <em>opposite</em> to that vertex. Then calculate the percentage
											of that area relative to the total area of the larger triangle.
										</p>

										<p>
											A similar approach was used in the Ray Tracer project to make surfaces appear smoother in triangle meshes
											(Phong Shading).

											I was first introduced to p5.js through the videos of <a href="https://shiffman.net/">Daniel Shiffman</a>,
											one of the directors of <a href="https://processingfoundation.org/">The Processing Foundation</a>. In his
											channel on YouTube, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain">The Coding Train</a>, I learned not
											only about the methods of p5.js but also the math and algorithms behind them.
										</p>
										
										<p>
											As explained in the <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6bgPNQAdxQZpJuJCjeOr7VD">Coding
											Train playlist</a>, <em>Perlin noise</em> is a random number generator where each number that it outputs is
											relatively close to the numbers that came before and after it.
										</p>

										<p>
											In my code, I use these values to represent the angle of rotation of each tiny bar, which you can see in the
											GIF below. I use the sin function to map the colors blue and red to their rotation.

										<p>
											The <em>Mandelbrot set</em> is a set of complex numbers that look pretty when plotted in a complex plane
											like the one below:
										</p>
										
										<figure role="group">
											<img src="media/miniatures/mandelbrot.png" alt="An almost entirely black image with a white bordered structure
											composed of two blobs: one in a cardioid format and the other, smaller, more round shape, glued next to each
											other, follewed by a straight thin line. These blobs appear to repeat around the edge of this structure, in a
											fractal manner."/>
											<figcaption>
												See <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/arturo32/sketches/OyFecBUxQ">code of the Mandelbrot set.</a>
											</figcaption>
										</figure>

										<p>To generate this is relative simple. It all boils down to the function below:</p>
										
										<p class="equation">\(f_c(z) = z^2 + c\)</p>

										<p>We will talk about the both complex numbers \(z\) and \(c\) soon. First, we need another pair of numbers:</p>

										<ul>
											<li>A positive number greater than 2. Let's call it the <em>threshold</em>;</li>
											<li>Another positive number. This time a larger one. This will be our <em>number of iterations</em>.</li>
										</ul>

										<p>
											Now, we apply our function recursively to <em>each pixel</em> of an image representing the complex plane.
											We do this by making \(c\) the coordinate of the current pixel and \(z\) starting with the value \(0 + 0i\).
											As we iterate, \(z\) may or may not grow beyond our <em>threshold</em>. If it gets there before we reach the
											<em>number of iterations</em>, we stop the recursion and paint the pixel <em>white</em>. If not, we paint it
											<em>black</em>. That's it!
										</p>

										<p>
											And <em>Julia sets</em> are almost the same thing, with \(c\) and \(z\) switching places, i.e., \(z\) will
											represent a pixel coordinate while \(c\) will be... an arbitrary constant! For each \(c\) we choose at the
											start of our process, we can make entirely different sets. Each of them possessing a unique complexity and
											beauty. And for making things even prettier we can add a little bit of math magic to the RGB values, changing
											them by how fast some of the inputs can reach our <em>threshold</em>, like the image below made with
											\(c = 0 - 0.8i\):
										</p>

										<figure role="group">
											<img src="media/miniatures/julia.png" title="Julia set" alt="A very colorful julia set with a black center
											that resembles a worm in a z format." style="width: 100%"/>
											<figcaption>
												See <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/arturo32/sketches/9sfTuuGoA">code of this big Julia set.</a>
											</figcaption>
										</figure>

										<p>
											Finally, the GIF of the thumbnail of this project was made by changing \(c\) as the coordinates of the cursor.
											So at each new position of the mouse the function iterated thought all the pixels to render the image for that
											particular set. To save the processor, I made the function skip some pixels. This is why the colors are a bit
											washed out.
										</p>

										colors are very pale pastels from pink to blue to yellow. As the cursor moves, the boundary of the circle
										morphs drastically, with opposite sides of the circle merging in a psychedelic way."/>

								<h4>Times table</h4>
								<div class="project-container">
									<img src="media/miniatures/times-table.gif" alt="A 2-second GIF showing a circle with many green lines connecting
									different sides of its circumference. The number of these lines increases rapidly, forming an image of what

								<p>Wonderful patterns emerge when numbers are written in a circle.</p>

								<dialog class="project-details modal" aria-modal="true" aria-labelledby="timesTableTitle">
									<div class="modal-content">
										<button type="button" class="close" aria-label="Close">&times;</button>
										<h3 id="timesTableTitle">Times table</h3>
										<p>
											...times table? That's right! The GIF in the thumbnail is simply a 2 times table, where each point
											on the circumference is a number and each line connects a number to its double. Thus, 2 connects to
											4, 3 connects to 6, and so on. In the image below we only have 12 numbers. So, from 6 and beyond we
											do what's called clock arithmetic, or more precisely, modular arithmetic. 0 is 12, 1 is 13, 2 is 14,
											and so on... This relation between the numbers is called <em>congruence</em>. That's why 6 connects
											to 0 and 7 connects to 2. We can called it the <em>2 time table module 12</em>:
										</p>
										<img src="media/miniatures/2-times-table-with-numbers.png" style="width: 500px;" alt="A circle with 10
										green lines connecting 12 labeled numbers on its circumference from 0 to 11. They form an image that is
										symmetrical about the horizontal axis."/>

										<p>
											I discovered this in the <a href="https://youtu.be/qhbuKbxJsk8">Mathologer video</a>. When you add more
											numbers, i.e., change the module, a cardioid starts to appear in the 2 times table:
										</p>

										different sides of its circumference. The number of these lines increases rapidly, forming an image of what

										<p>
											And when you choose bigger numbers to represent their times table, intriguing patterns starts to appear:

										<p>
											When I saw my colleagues struggling with the concepts of pointers in introductory programming classes,
											I thought of writing a program that could help them visualize what happens in the computer's memory when
											they run their programs.
										</p>

										<p>
											So 2 years ago I started making a website that shows memory allocation of variables and their pointers
											as they are typed into a console.
										</p>

										<p>
											As of now it can identify declaration and assignment of variables and pointers and their types, as well as
											dereferencing of pointers. It cannot yet identify arrays (which are sort of pointers, important
											ones!). I plan to use Vue.js to manage the visualization of the memory cells instead of p5.js and to
											finish it this year.

										<h3 id="rayTracerTitle">Ray Tracer</h3>
										<p>This project was developed by me and my friend <a href="https://github.com/JohnVithor">João Vítor</a> throughout the course of Computer Graphics, taught by professor <a href="https://sigaa.ufrn.br/sigaa/public/docente/portal.jsf?siape=2497950">Selan Rodrigues dos Santos</a>. It creates images representing 3D scenes described by XML files. All of this using the magic of ray tracing.</p>

										<p>Ray tracing is a technique used to create 3D images where <em>photo-realism</em> is desired. It works by <em>simulating</em> photons of <em>light</em> as <em>rays</em> (vectors) that are shot at the scene from the viewer's perspective. The rays then travel through the scene being <em>reflected, refracted or absorbed</em> by objects. All of these interactions are calculated for <em>each pixel</em> of the image, defining its final color.</p>

										<p>Doing this project was challenging because of its size. We had to take into account the <em>camera</em>, <em>objects</em> and their <em>interactions with rays</em>, different <em>types of lights</em>, different <em>light models</em>, parsing <em>XML files</em> and <em>.obj files</em>... At the same time it was very rewarding because at each step we could <em>see</em> the result of what we had done at that point.</p>

										<p>In the end, we couldn't believe the images that our own program made! The (optional) spherical background made the reflective surfaces much more interesting!</p>

				<h3>Origami</h3>
				<p>Without scissors or glue, intriguing forms can emerge from a flat sheet of paper. I discovered the art of origami when I was 8 years old. Since then, I've learned that I can fold literally everything I can imagine - as in painting, it doesn't have to be realistic - just from creativity, technique and a bit of suggestion. Below are some of my favorite designs that I have had the opportunity to fold:</p>

				<h3>Photography</h3>
				<p>It was through photographing my origamis that I began to pay more attention to lighting, composition and photography in general. I've found great pleasure in photographing nature and all its little living things.</p>
